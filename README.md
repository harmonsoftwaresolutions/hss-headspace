## Why?
I'm a consultant, software engineer, cloud architect, devops pro and I can't remember everything. This is the swap file for my brain. I need to store, access, and quickly retrieve what I have learned!

## How to run in development mode with concurrently
`yarn start`

## Graphiql
The graphiql query tool can be found at: `localhost:3001/graphiql`
